# Preprocessing your data (private preview)

Multivariate industrial time series data can be challenging to deal with, this article will show you how to Use preprocessing your data to Metrics Advisor for equipment.

## Data format requirements 

Data format should be storing all the sensor data in one file/table.

- One table/ file per asset.
- All sensors from that asset are represented in that one file/table.

## Data schema requirements 

Metrics Advisor for equipment uses your data in the follwoing steps:

- to train a model. 
- to evaluate a model
- to conduct a near real time inference

Metrics Advisor for equipment accepts tables with only three columns;The first column headers of the file are a timestamp that indicates the date and time. The second column headers contain the sensor name. The third column headers show the data value from the sensor.

| Timestamp     | Sensor  name | Sensor  value |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 1/1/2020 0:00 | Sensor 1     | 2             |
| 1/1/2020 0:00 | Sensor  2    | 6             |
| 1/1/2020 0:05 | Sensor  1    | 4             |
| 1/1/2020 0:05 | Sensor  2    | 4             |
| 1/1/2020 0:10 | Sensor  1    | 5             |


Timestamp :  with type of Date Time or String. When this column isn't set, the timestamp is set as the start time of each ingestion period. Format the timestamp as follows: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm.

The easiest way to prevent problems with column headers is to take the following precautions:
o	Make sure your column headers don't include any invalid characters, such as spaces.
o	Valid characters are: 200 characters.
o	Valid characters are: 0-9, a-z, A-Z, and # $ . \ - (hyphen) _ (underscore)
o	Make sure that the timestamp column is the one furthest to the left in your CSV file.
o	Make sure that you don't have any duplicated column headers.
